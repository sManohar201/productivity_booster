# Development Environment Setup & Initial Deployment - PRD

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for setting up the development environment, CI/CD pipeline, and initial deployment strategy for the Productivity Booster application across multiple platforms.

## 2. Goals
- Create a consistent development environment
- Enable testing on multiple devices (Android, iPad, Windows)
- Implement automated CI/CD pipelines
- Ensure smooth deployment to production
- Provide clear documentation for the team

## 3. User Stories
- As a developer, I want a one-command setup to get started
- As a tester, I want to test the app on multiple devices easily
- As a team lead, I want automated testing before deployment
- As a product owner, I want clear deployment processes
- As a new team member, I want comprehensive setup documentation

## 4. Functional Requirements

```

### 4.2 Development Environment
1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 18+
   - Python 3.10+
   - Docker Desktop
   - Git
   - VS Code (recommended)

2. **Setup Scripts**
   - `setup.sh` / `setup.ps1` for one-command setup
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Dependency installation

### 4.3 CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Testing Workflow**
   - Run on every push/pull request
   - Linting and type checking
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests

2. **Build Workflow**
   - Build Android APK/IPA
   - Run end-to-end tests
   - Create release artifacts

3. **Deployment Workflow**
   - Deploy backend to staging/production
   - Publish mobile apps to TestFlight/Play Store
   - Update documentation

### 4.4 Multi-Platform Testing
1. **Android**
   - Physical device via USB debugging
   - Emulator setup
   - Firebase Test Lab integration

2. **iOS/iPadOS**
   - Xcode setup for iOS simulators
   - TestFlight distribution
   - Physical device testing

3. **Windows**
   - Web version testing
   - Windows Subsystem for Android
   - BrowserStack integration

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Setting up individual developer machines
- Advanced CI/CD for multiple environments
- Load testing infrastructure
- Advanced monitoring setup

## 6. Design Considerations
- **Developer Experience**
  - Minimal setup steps
  - Clear error messages
  - Fast feedback loops

- **Security**
  - Secure credential storage
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - Secret management

- **Performance**
  - Fast build times
  - Efficient testing
  - Caching strategies

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Backend (Django)
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching
- Celery for background tasks
- Django REST Framework
- Docker for containerization

### 7.2 Mobile (React Native)
- Expo for development
- React Navigation
- Redux Toolkit
- React Native Paper
- TypeScript

### 7.3 Infrastructure
- Docker Compose for local development
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- AWS/GCP for production
- Firebase for mobile services

## 8. Success Metrics
- Time to set up development environment (< 30 minutes)
- Test coverage (> 80%)
- Build time (< 10 minutes)
- Deployment frequency (multiple times per day)
- Time to recover from failures (< 1 hour)

## 9. Open Questions
- Which cloud provider to use for production?
- What's the backup strategy for the database?
- How to handle environment-specific configurations?
- What's the rollback strategy?

## 10. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Local Development Setup (Week 1)
1. Create project structure
2. Set up backend with Docker
3. Configure React Native with Expo
4. Create basic CI pipeline
5. Document setup process

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure (Week 2)
1. Set up testing frameworks
2. Configure device testing
3. Implement E2E tests
4. Set up test reporting

### Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline (Week 3)
1. Configure staging environment
2. Set up production deployment
3. Implement monitoring
4. Create rollback procedures

## 11. Documentation

### Setup Guide
```markdown
# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- Docker Desktop
- Git

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
2. Run setup script:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   .\scripts\setup.ps1
   
   # Mac/Linux
   chmod +x ./scripts/setup.sh
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
3. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start backend
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Start mobile app
   cd apps/mobile
   npm start
   ```

## Testing on Devices
- **Android**: Connect device and run `npm run android`
- **iOS**: Open Xcode and run on simulator/device
