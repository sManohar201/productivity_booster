# Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for Phase 1 of the Productivity Booster app, focusing on establishing the technical foundation and implementing core authentication features. This phase will set up the development environment, configure the tech stack, and implement secure user authentication.

## 2. Goals
- Set up a robust development environment for both frontend and backend
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization
- Establish CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Ensure proper error tracking and logging infrastructure
- Create a solid foundation for future feature development

## 3. User Stories

### Project Setup
- As a developer, I want a well-structured project setup so that I can efficiently build and maintain the application
- As a team member, I want consistent development environments to avoid "works on my machine" issues
- As a devops engineer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth deployments

### Authentication
- As a new user, I want to create an account using email/password so that I can access the app
- As a user, I want to log in using my Google/Apple account for convenience
- As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it
- As a user, I want to view and edit my basic profile information
- As a security-conscious user, I want my credentials to be stored securely

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Project Setup
1. **Frontend Setup**
   - Initialize React Native project with TypeScript
   - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript
   - Set up basic navigation structure
   - Implement theming system
   - Configure environment variables

2. **Backend Setup**
   - Set up Django with PostgreSQL
   - Configure Django REST Framework
   - Set up database models and migrations
   - Implement custom user model
   - Configure CORS and security settings

3. **DevOps**
   - Set up Docker and Docker Compose for local development
   - Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry)
   - Configure logging infrastructure

### 4.2 Authentication System
1. **Email/Password Authentication**
   - User registration with email verification
   - Secure password reset flow
   - Account confirmation emails
   - Rate limiting for auth endpoints

2. **Social Authentication**
   - Google OAuth2 integration
   - Apple Sign In integration
   - Account linking for multiple auth methods

3. **Session Management**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Refresh token implementation
   - Token blacklisting
   - Session timeout handling

4. **User Profile**
   - Basic profile information (name, profile picture)
   - Email management
   - Account deletion
   - Password change functionality

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Advanced user settings and preferences
- Team/Organization management
- Subscription/billing integration
- Advanced profile customization
- Social features (friends, sharing)

## 6. Design Considerations

### UI/UX
- Clean, minimal authentication screens
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Loading states and error handling
- Clear error messages for auth failures

### Security
- Password hashing with Argon2id
- HTTPS enforcement
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Secure cookie settings
- Input validation and sanitization

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Frontend
- React Native 0.70+
- React Navigation 6
- TypeScript 4.9+
- React Hook Form for forms
- React Query for data fetching
- Secure storage for tokens

### Backend
- Django 4.2+
- Django REST Framework
- Django Allauth for authentication
- Django REST Framework Simple JWT
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis for caching

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Sentry for error tracking
- PostgreSQL for production database
- AWS/GCP for hosting

## 8. Success Metrics
- Successful user registration and login
- < 2s response time for auth endpoints
- 99.9% uptime for auth services
- < 0.1% error rate on auth endpoints
- Successful CI/CD pipeline runs
- Proper error tracking and logging

## 9. Open Questions
- Should we implement MFA in this phase or later?
- What are the specific requirements for password complexity?
- Should we implement account recovery options beyond email?
- What are the specific data retention policies we need to comply with?

## 10. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can register with email/password
- [ ] User can log in with email/password
- [ ] User can log in with Google/Apple
- [ ] User can reset forgotten password
- [ ] User can view/edit basic profile
- [ ] Authentication tokens are properly validated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is set up and working
- [ ] Error tracking is properly configured
- [ ] Basic logging is in place
- [ ] Code passes all linting and type checks
