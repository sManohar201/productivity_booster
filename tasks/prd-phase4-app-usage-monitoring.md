# Phase 4: App Usage Monitoring - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This phase focuses on implementing comprehensive app usage monitoring to help users understand and manage their digital habits. The system will track app usage patterns, provide insights, and help users reduce digital distractions.

## 2. Goals
- Track and categorize app usage across the device
- Provide actionable insights on digital habits
- Help users reduce time spent on distracting apps
- Maintain user privacy while collecting usage data
- Provide gentle, effective intervention mechanisms

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to see how much time I spend on different apps
- As a user, I want to set daily limits for specific app categories
- As a user, I want to receive gentle reminders when I exceed my set limits
- As a user, I want to see my usage patterns over time
- As a user, I want to block distracting apps during focus sessions

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. **App Usage Tracking**
   - Background monitoring of app usage
   - Categorization of apps (Productivity, Social, Entertainment, etc.)
   - Detailed usage statistics (time spent, sessions, pickups)
   - Battery usage impact monitoring

2. **Usage Limits & Alerts**
   - Set daily/weekly limits for app categories
   - Customizable notification thresholds
   - Gentle reminder system
   - Break suggestions based on usage

3. **Focus Mode Integration**
   - Automatic app blocking during focus sessions
   - Whitelist/blacklist functionality
   - Emergency bypass options
   - Session-based blocking rules

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- System-level app blocking on iOS (due to platform restrictions)
- Monitoring of app content
- Cross-device tracking
- Real-time monitoring of other users

## 6. Design Considerations
- Privacy-first approach to data collection
- Clear visualization of usage data
- Non-intrusive notifications
- Battery-efficient background processing
- User control over data collection

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Platform-specific APIs for usage tracking
- Background processing constraints
- Battery optimization techniques
- Data aggregation and storage
- Privacy-preserving data collection

## 8. Success Metrics
- Reduction in time spent on distracting apps
- User engagement with usage insights
- Number of active usage limits set
- User retention and satisfaction
- Battery impact (<2% per day)

## 9. Open Questions
- How to handle system apps vs user apps?
- What's the optimal frequency for usage data sync?
- How to handle app categorization for less common apps?
- What level of detail should be shown in usage reports?
