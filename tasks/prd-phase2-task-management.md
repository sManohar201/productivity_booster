# Phase 2: Basic Task Management & Focus Timer - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for Phase 2 of the Productivity Booster app, focusing on implementing core task management functionality and a basic focus timer. This phase will enable users to manage their tasks effectively and use a Pomodoro-style focus timer to enhance productivity.

## 2. Goals
- Provide users with intuitive task management capabilities
- Implement a simple yet effective focus timer
- Enable basic task organization and prioritization
- Track focus sessions and provide simple analytics
- Lay the foundation for more advanced productivity features

## 3. User Stories

### Task Management
- As a user, I want to create tasks with titles and descriptions
- As a user, I want to categorize my tasks
- As a user, I want to set due dates and reminders for tasks
- As a user, I want to prioritize my tasks
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete
- As a user, I want to edit and delete tasks
- As a user, I want to view my tasks in different layouts (list/calendar)

### Focus Timer
- As a user, I want to start a focus session for a specific task
- As a user, I want to use a Pomodoro timer with work/break intervals
- As a user, I want to see my focus session history
- As a user, I want to view simple statistics about my focus sessions
- As a user, I want to pause and resume focus sessions

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Task Management
1. **Task CRUD Operations**
   - Create, read, update, and delete tasks
   - Task fields: title, description, due date, priority, status, category
   - Soft delete functionality
   - Batch operations (delete/update multiple tasks)

2. **Task Organization**
   - Default categories (Work, Personal, Health, Learning, Other)
   - Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
   - Due date and reminder settings
   - Basic search and filter functionality

3. **Task Views**
   - List view (grouped by date/category/priority)
   - Calendar view (monthly/weekly/daily)
   - Today/Upcoming/Completed views
   - Task count and completion statistics

### 4.2 Focus Timer
1. **Timer Functionality**
   - Pomodoro technique implementation (25/5 default)
   - Customizable work/break durations
   - Auto-start next session option
   - Session pause/resume functionality
   - Visual and audio notifications

2. **Task Integration**
   - Associate focus sessions with specific tasks
   - Track time spent on each task
   - Mark task as complete after a session

3. **Session History & Analytics**
   - Daily/weekly focus time tracking
   - Completed tasks statistics
   - Focus time distribution by task/category
   - Basic productivity trends

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Advanced task dependencies
- Recurring tasks
- Task sharing/collaboration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external task managers
- Advanced timer features (custom intervals, white noise, etc.)

## 6. Design Considerations

### UI/UX
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Quick add task functionality
- Visual indicators for task priority and due dates
- Intuitive timer controls
- Progress visualization
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

### Data Model
```
Task
- id: UUID
- user: ForeignKey(User)
- title: String
- description: Text (optional)
- due_date: DateTime (optional)
- priority: Choice (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- category: ForeignKey(Category)
- status: Choice (Todo, In Progress, Done, Archived)
- created_at: DateTime
- updated_at: DateTime
- completed_at: DateTime (optional)

FocusSession
- id: UUID
- user: ForeignKey(User)
- task: ForeignKey(Task, optional)
- start_time: DateTime
- end_time: DateTime (optional)
- duration: Integer (in seconds)
- session_type: Choice (Focus, Short Break, Long Break)
- status: Choice (Completed, Incomplete, Abandoned)
- notes: Text (optional)
```

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Frontend
- React Native Reanimated for smooth animations
- React Navigation for task views
- Formik for form handling
- Date-fns for date manipulation
- React Native MMKV for local storage caching
- React Native Vector Icons for UI elements

### Backend
- Django REST Framework viewsets for CRUD operations
- Django Filter for task filtering
- Django REST Framework Simple JWT for authentication
- PostgreSQL full-text search for task search
- Django Signals for task completion events

### Performance
- Pagination for task lists
- Optimistic UI updates
- Efficient database indexing
- Caching for frequently accessed data

## 8. Success Metrics
- Task creation and completion rate
- Average number of tasks created per user
- Focus session completion rate
- Average focus session duration
- User engagement with the timer feature
- Task completion rate before due date
- User retention rate

## 9. Open Questions
- Should we implement local notifications for task reminders?
- What should be the maximum number of tasks a user can create?
- Should we implement task archiving or just soft delete?
- What analytics would be most valuable for users in this phase?
- Should we allow users to customize the default Pomodoro intervals?

- [ ] Tasks can be categorized and prioritized
- [ ] Due dates and reminders can be set for tasks
