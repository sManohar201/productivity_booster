# Phase 3: AI-Enhanced Task & Focus Features - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for Phase 3 of the Productivity Booster app, focusing on introducing AI-powered task management and enhanced focus session features. This phase will leverage AI to make task management more intuitive and focus sessions more effective.

## 2. Goals
- Implement AI-powered task suggestions and auto-categorization
- Enhance focus sessions with intelligent scheduling and adaptive timing
- Improve task management with smart prioritization
- Provide personalized productivity insights
- Lay the groundwork for advanced AI features in future phases

## 3. User Stories

### AI Task Management
- As a user, I want the app to suggest tasks based on my calendar and habits
- As a user, I want tasks to be automatically categorized
- As a user, I want the app to predict how long tasks will take
- As a user, I want the app to suggest the best time to work on tasks
- As a user, I want to receive smart task recommendations

### Enhanced Focus Sessions
- As a user, I want the app to suggest optimal focus session lengths
- As a user, I want the app to adapt break times based on my energy levels
- As a user, I want to see insights about my most productive times
- As a user, I want the app to suggest when to take breaks
- As a user, I want to track my focus metrics over time

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 AI Task Management
1. **Smart Task Suggestions**
   - Analyze calendar events to suggest relevant tasks
   - Learn from user behavior to improve suggestions
   - Provide context-aware task recommendations
   - Allow users to accept/reject suggestions

2. **Auto-Categorization**
   - Automatically categorize new tasks using AI
   - Allow users to correct categorizations for learning
   - Support custom categories
   - Bulk categorization of existing tasks

3. **Time Estimation**
   - Predict task duration based on historical data
   - Adjust estimates as user completes similar tasks
   - Provide confidence levels for estimates
   - Allow manual override of estimates

### 4.2 Enhanced Focus Sessions
1. **Adaptive Focus Timer**
   - Suggest optimal work/break intervals
   - Adjust session length based on time of day and energy levels
   - Provide gentle notifications for session transitions
   - Support custom timer presets

2. **Energy Level Tracking**
   - Simple energy level logging (1-5 scale)
   - Correlate energy levels with productivity
   - Suggest optimal work times based on patterns
   - Provide insights about energy/productivity correlations

3. **Productivity Insights**
   - Daily/weekly productivity reports
   - Focus session effectiveness metrics
   - Task completion rate analysis
   - Personalized productivity recommendations

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Full natural language processing for task entry
- Advanced machine learning model training
- Integration with health/fitness trackers
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced reporting and analytics

## 6. Design Considerations

### UI/UX
- Clear distinction between AI suggestions and user content
- Non-intrusive AI features that enhance rather than disrupt
- Easy ways to provide feedback on AI suggestions
- Transparent explanations for AI decisions
- Privacy-first approach to data collection

### Data Model
```
AITaskSuggestion
- id: UUID
- user: ForeignKey(User)
- suggested_task: ForeignKey(Task)
- confidence_score: Float
- accepted: Boolean
- feedback: Text (optional)
- created_at: DateTime

FocusSessionPattern
- id: UUID
- user: ForeignKey(User)
- day_of_week: Integer
- hour_of_day: Integer
- average_energy: Float
- average_productivity: Float
- session_count: Integer
- last_updated: DateTime

UserProductivityInsight
- id: UUID
- user: ForeignKey(User)
- insight_type: Choice (BEST_TIME, TASK_TYPE, etc.)
- insight_data: JSONField
- generated_at: DateTime
- is_active: Boolean
```

## 7. Technical Considerations

### AI/ML Components
- Lightweight NLP for task categorization
- Time series analysis for productivity patterns
- Simple recommendation engine
- On-device processing where possible

### Frontend
- React Native Reanimated for smooth animations
- Custom components for AI suggestions
- Data visualization for insights
- Offline support for AI features

### Backend
- Django REST Framework API endpoints
- Celery tasks for background processing
- Caching for AI predictions
- Rate limiting for AI features

### Performance
- Efficient data processing for on-device AI
- Background sync for AI model updates
- Battery optimization for continuous tracking
- Data compression for analytics

## 8. Success Metrics
- AI suggestion acceptance rate (>60% target)
- Task categorization accuracy (>80% target)
- Time estimation accuracy (within 20% of actual)
- User engagement with AI features
- Improvement in task completion rate
- User satisfaction with focus session recommendations
- Reduction in user-reported stress levels

## 9. Open Questions
- What privacy controls should we implement for AI features?
- How frequently should we retrain the AI models?
- What's the best way to collect user feedback on AI suggestions?
- Should we implement different AI models for different user segments?
- How do we handle edge cases in time estimation?
